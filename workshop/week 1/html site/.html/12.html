       <p>Thomas John. Watson(Feburary 17, 1874- June 19, 1956), American business executive, assumed the management of 
        International Business Machines in 1914 and built it into one of the world's largest corporations.Thomas J. Watson 
        was born Feb. 17, 1874, in Campbell, N. Y. He attended the Adison Academy but turned down his father's offer to 
        pay his college expenses. Instead, he took a short course in the Elmira School of Commerce and became a salesman 
        in Painted Post,New York.</p>
        
        <p>In 1898 Watson joined the fast-growing National Cash Register Company as salesman. His first efforts were less 
        than spectacular, but he received encouragement from his superiors, who realized the difficulty of the product 
        market. During the next 15 years he moved steadily up the ladder, eventually becoming general sales manager.
        While working on advertising material, Watson produced a sign which read "THINK." This attracted John Patterson, 
        the company's founder, who ordered copies for all offices.Watson left National Cash Register in 1913 after a 
        dispute over an antitrust legal issue and became president of Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. The firm 
        was a small holding company which controlled four other small firms that produced a punch-card tabulator, time 
        clocks, and other machines. About this time Watson married Jeannette M. Kittredge, who bore him four children.</p>
        
        <p>One of Watson's first tasks with his new firm involved the negotiation of a loan for expansion. Watson, like 
        many other businessmen of his era, embraced the concept of research and development, and much of the borrowed 
        funds went into an engineering laboratory. From this and other laboratories came new machines such as the key 
        punch, card sorters, tabulators, and eventually the computer. In 1924 the firm merged with International Business 
        Machines Corporation (IBM) and took its name. The success of Watson's leadership is dramatically revealed by 
        investment data. One hundred shares, which would have cost $2, 750 in 1914, by 1956 were equivalent to 3, 990
         shares valued at $2, 164, 000. By 1941 IBM held nearly 1, 400 patents on various types of business machines.</p>
        
        <p>Having been a salesman, Watson placed great emphasis on that area of company activity. He insisted that IBM 
        salesmen know how to install and service products as well as sell them. Labor conditions and benefits were
        always regarded as excellent. IBM became a virtual monopoly, largely because of its patents and because the
        firm chose to rent its equipment rather than sell it. In 1952 the Federal government instigated an antitrust 
        suit against IBM, charging that the firm controlled over 90 percent of all the tabulating machines in the 
        country. The company agreed to a consent decree in 1956, by which competition was ensured.Watson had many
        other interests outside the business world. For many years he served as a trustee for Columbia University. 
        He participated in many ways to encourage and support the fine arts and gave financial assistance to all 
        religious groups. He served as president of the International Chamber of Commerce. Watson acted as an adviser
        to several U.S. presidents. He died on July 19, 1956, in New York City.</p>
